RIP to our brother with almost 200k in puts. He single handedly cancelled iphone tariffs, what a martyr I thought China was screwing us over? So Trump is ok with China screwing us over on electronics? None of this makes any fucking sense. These are precisely the industries you'd wanna tariff if you really wanna make American manufacturing great again or whatever Wonderful. Liberation fucking day was nothing but an exercise in nuking the reputation of the dollar and America as a safe haven. At least we now won’t have the tariffs that never existed to begin with. The US President paused tariffs for 90 days on non-retaliating nations, boosting markets and launching talks with Vietnam. Tech and EV sectors surged despite global tariff tensions, but Microsoft and Apple faced operational shifts amid trade strains. An analyst downplays the long-term impact of escalating U.S.-China tariff rhetoric, suggesting that the latest threats may be largely symbolic and unlikely to result in sustained economic disruption.","Investor note: AAPL has shown signs of mixed sentiment throughout the day, with a sentiment score of 0.165, indicating a small positive trend but not robust enough for short-term gains. The stock is trading near its high point at $200 and faces significant risks due to rising prices and consumer demand concerns, despite Trump's occasional tweets about tariffs. The market appears poised for short-term recovery in tech sectors while also exposed to geopolitical tensions from China. However, the overall sentiment remains mixed, suggesting potential volatility ahead."

- How to solve this:
- Time to invest into a conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio!
- Is it really too much to ask to get my Baconator on a payment plan??
- Son of Baconator for $3 with free frosty key tag
- Bullish $WEN
- Who knew wimpy’s “I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today” line was going to be prophetic.
- Klarna defended its business model in a blog post, saying because it does not charge interest, it relies on customers paying on time, as opposed to credit cards. Those who miss payments are cut off from deferring more, a practice that leaves 99% of its lending repaid, it said. Its average user owes the company $100.
- I have a feeling the average loan owed to Klarna will increase once this becomes active on DoorDash. Also they are just saying that as long as you make a payment on time you can continue deferring more without necessarily stating what the max amount allowable would be.
- Word on the curb is Buffet been slowly cashing out the past 5 years.
- Here is the link to the CFPB report (and the in-depth PDF I got the tables from) if you want to read
- Worth reading with the recent Klarna going to DoorDash move, especially if you plan on getting in on their IPO. This industry is propped up by nearly 2/3rds subprime (read: shit) borrowers with a significantly higher rate of loan stacking compared to the average creditor, who are using it because they usually can't even get credit cards.
- And at least before it was just for shit like couches off Amazon or a new PS5. Now we're gonna have a chunk of our market - about 60% of the 1/5th of Americans who originate BNPL - perpetually underwater on stacking pizza debt.

It seems like RH exercised my degen $SAVEQ cash secured put options that they shouldn’t be able to since they have nothing to begin with and they can make something (e.g. cash settle it) out of nothing just as you can’t make stuff up out of thin air. What would my legal discourses be in situations like this?","- Join WSB Discord
- I don't really see the error with Robinhoods explanation.
- Are you of the impression that since the stock went bankrupt your cash secured puts you sold got a get out of jail free card?
- You owe the entire thing lol
- Op is a regard, he doesn’t understand what “cash settled” means. #never traded index options probably either
- Ticker: SAVEQ
- Direction: OP thinks they were wrongly assigned shares on cash-secured puts.
- Prognosis: OP believes Robinhood shouldn't have assigned the puts because the underlying shares were delisted before assignment, resulting in a cash settlement of $0. They are seeking legal recourse.
- OP's Confusion (In a Nutshell): If there were no shares to be assigned, why was OP debited $150? Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.
- Robinhood's response: The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process. There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.
- Additional Notes: This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures. The user seems to fundamentally misunderstand how cash settlement of options contracts works when the underlying asset ceases trading before expiration. Consulting with a securities lawyer specializing in options and OCC regulations is recommended for OP.
- ai ftw
- I read this entire thing and understood nothing.
- So did OP
- No, rh is entirely right and youre trying to sovereign citizen your way out of it.
- Thank fuck for the AI because you need to learn how to get your point across without posting 20 fucking pictures lmaooo
- This is just how options work… you sold someone a contract stating you’ll pay them $1.50 per share they own if they choose to exercise it. The shares went to zero, and they chose to exercise the contract. So you paid them $1.50 per share they own, and the shares were transferred from them to you. Since the shares are worth $0, they’re reflected as non existent in your account. Nothing to really sue over. It’s like a fire insurance company suing a client for getting an insurance payout after their house burns down."

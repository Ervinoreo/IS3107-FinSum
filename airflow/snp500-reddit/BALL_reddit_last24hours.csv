I know this sub is all about ""line goes up who cares""
But even after the recent drop, the P/E ratio is still around 110-120.
Doesn't that mean it would take 110 years of profit to buy the entire company at the current stock price?
What technology or product is going to come online that will make Tesla's profit increase ten fold?
For fuck sake, it is a car company ... And they have never sold that many cars when you compare to other car companies.
Someone that truly believes in the stock, explain to me like I am 5 why it will be more valuable in the future.
No political bullshit please, focus on business fundamentals.

So, so summarize:
FSD Is around the corner, and that will essentially turn every tesla in to a Taxi and they will make people money when they are not using them. (Same lie from 2017? Could be true now??)
The Robots will be the greatest product to ever exist, and will create never ending abundance, and everyone will have everything they want. (Boston Dynamics /waves hello)
They are really an AI company, and oh... they are the best AI company and are already better than everyone else, with their best chips.. (So blatantly false i just don't even know what to say, Didn't be try to buy OpenAI because his AI sucks balls??)","- Join WSB Discord
- Sir this is a casino.
- Fundamentals don’t mean shit
- It's all about feelings
- Didn't you hear Elon talk? He said one tesla car will become equal to 5 or 6 cars. So PE of 110 will become PE of 18-22 and problem is solved.
- I guess, tesla cars will soon start producing offspring at the same rate as Elon.
- Sir, this is a meme stock. Stop trying to justify anything about it.
- Might as well be justify how Fartcoin can be worth $450m. But here we are.
- Hot air rises
- The thesis is that it's not a car company but an AI powerhouse in robo taxis and now robots. About 5-10 years ago the bull thesis was it was a full driverless cars and solar/energy storage.
- It’s the famous Deez Principal. It’s like a fundamental of market dynamics. 
- It’s all computer.
- I love tesler!"

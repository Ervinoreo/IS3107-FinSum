- I'm confused... screenshot is red, but position seems to be up?
- It may be about fat loss?
- He went full margin"

I know this sub is all about ""line goes up who cares""
But even after the recent drop, the P/E ratio is still around 110-120.
Doesn't that mean it would take 110 years of profit to buy the entire company at the current stock price?
What technology or product is going to come online that will make Tesla's profit increase ten fold?
For fuck sake, it is a car company ... And they have never sold that many cars when you compare to other car companies.
Someone that truly believes in the stock, explain to me like I am 5 why it will be more valuable in the future.
No political bullshit please, focus on business fundamentals.
EDIT below
I did watch this in it's entirety, someone linked it in a reply, then deleted their comment, strange..
But thank you guy that deleted your comment. https://www.youtube.com/live/QGJysv_Qzkw?si=dDKqc882bW84a8t5
So, so summarize:
FSD Is around the corner, and that will essentially turn every tesla in to a Taxi and they will make people money when they are not using them. (Same lie from 2017? Could be true now??)
The Robots will be the greatest product to ever exist, and will create never ending abundance, and everyone will have everything they want. (Boston Dynamics /waves hello)
They are really an AI company, and oh... they are the best AI company and are already better than everyone else, with their best chips.. (So blatantly false i just don't even know what to say, Didn't be try to buy OpenAI because his AI sucks balls??)","- Join WSB Discord
- Sir this is a casino.
- Fundamentals don’t mean shit
- It's all about feelings
- Didn't you hear Elon talk? He said one tesla car will become equal to 5 or 6 cars. So PE of 110 will become PE of 18-22 and problem is solved.
- I guess, tesla cars will soon start producing offspring at the same rate as Elon.
- Sir, this is a meme stock. Stop trying to justify anything about it.
- Might as well be justify how Fartcoin can be worth $450m. But here we are.
- Hot air rises
- The thesis is that it's not a car company but an AI powerhouse in robo taxis and now robots. About 5-10 years ago the bull thesis was it was a full driverless cars and solar/energy storage.
- It’s the famous Deez Principal. It’s like a fundamental of market dynamics. 
- It’s all computer.
- I love tesler!"

It seems like RH exercised my degen $SAVEQ cash secured put options that they shouldn’t be able to since they have nothing to begin with and they can make something (e.g. cash settle it) out of nothing just as you can’t make stuff up out of thin air. What would my legal discourses be in situations like this?","- Join WSB Discord
- I don't really see the error with Robinhoods explanation.
- Are you of the impression that since the stock went bankrupt your cash secured puts you sold got a get out of jail free card?
- You owe the entire thing lol
- Op is a regard, he doesn’t understand what “cash settled” means. #never traded index options probably either
- Ticker: SAVEQ
- Direction: OP thinks they were wrongly assigned shares on cash-secured puts.
- Prognosis: OP believes Robinhood shouldn't have assigned the puts because the underlying shares were delisted before assignment, resulting in a cash settlement of $0. They are seeking legal recourse.
- OP's Confusion (In a Nutshell): If there were no shares to be assigned, why was OP debited $150? Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.
- Robinhood's response: The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process. There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.
- Additional Notes: This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures. The user seems to fundamentally misunderstand how cash settlement of options contracts works when the underlying asset ceases trading before expiration. Consulting with a securities lawyer specializing in options and OCC regulations is recommended for OP.
- ai ftw
- I read this entire thing and understood nothing.
- So did OP
- No, rh is entirely right and youre trying to sovereign citizen your way out of it.
- Thank fuck for the AI because you need to learn how to get your point across without posting 20 fucking pictures lmaooo
- This is just how options work… you sold someone a contract stating you’ll pay them $1.50 per share they own if they choose to exercise it. The shares went to zero, and they chose to exercise the contract. So you paid them $1.50 per share they own, and the shares were transferred from them to you. Since the shares are worth $0, they’re reflected as non existent in your account. Nothing to really sue over. It’s like a fire insurance company suing a client for getting an insurance payout after their house burns down."

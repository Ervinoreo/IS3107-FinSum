- How to solve this:
- Also, believe it or not, aliens.
- Time to invest into a conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio!
- Is it really too much to ask to get my Baconator on a payment plan??
- Who knew wimpy’s “I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today” line was going to be prophetic.
- Klarna defended its business model in a blog post, saying because it does not charge interest, it relies on customers paying on time, as opposed to credit cards. Those who miss payments are cut off from deferring more, a practice that leaves 99% of its lending repaid, it said. Its average user owes the company $100.
- I have a feeling the average loan owed to Klarna will increase once this becomes active on DoorDash. Also they are just saying that as long as you make a payment on time you can continue deferring more without necessarily stating what the max amount allowable would be.
- Word on the curb is Buffet been slowly cashing out the past 5 years.
- Here is the link to the CFPB report (and the in-depth PDF I got the tables from) if you want to read
- Worth reading with the recent Klarna going to DoorDash move, especially if you plan on getting in on their IPO. This industry is propped up by nearly 2/3rds subprime (read: shit) borrowers with a significantly higher rate of loan stacking compared to the average creditor, who are using it because they usually can't even get credit cards.
- And at least before it was just for shit like couches off Amazon or a new PS5. Now we're gonna have a chunk of our market - about 60% of the 1/5th of Americans who originate BNPL - perpetually underwater on stacking pizza debt.

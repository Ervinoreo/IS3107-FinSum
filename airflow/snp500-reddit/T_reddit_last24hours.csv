It seems like RH exercised my degen $SAVEQ cash secured put options that they shouldn’t be able to since they have nothing to begin with and they can make something (e.g. cash settle it) out of nothing just as you can’t make stuff up out of thin air. What would my legal discourses be in situations like this?","- Join WSB Discord
- I don't really see the error with Robinhoods explanation.
- Are you of the impression that since the stock went bankrupt your cash secured puts you sold got a get out of jail free card?
- You owe the entire thing lol
- Op is a regard, he doesn’t understand what “cash settled” means. #never traded index options probably either
- Ticker: SAVEQ
- Direction: OP thinks they were wrongly assigned shares on cash-secured puts.
- Prognosis: OP believes Robinhood shouldn't have assigned the puts because the underlying shares were delisted before assignment, resulting in a cash settlement of $0. They are seeking legal recourse.
- OP's Confusion (In a Nutshell): If there were no shares to be assigned, why was OP debited $150? Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.
- Robinhood's response: The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process. There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.
- Additional Notes: This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures. The user seems to fundamentally misunderstand how cash settlement of options contracts works when the underlying asset ceases trading before expiration. Consulting with a securities lawyer specializing in options and OCC regulations is recommended for OP.
- ai ftw
- I read this entire thing and understood nothing.
- So did OP
- No, rh is entirely right and youre trying to sovereign citizen your way out of it.
- Thank fuck for the AI because you need to learn how to get your point across without posting 20 fucking pictures lmaooo
- This is just how options work… you sold someone a contract stating you’ll pay them $1.50 per share they own if they choose to exercise it. The shares went to zero, and they chose to exercise the contract. So you paid them $1.50 per share they own, and the shares were transferred from them to you. Since the shares are worth $0, they’re reflected as non existent in your account. Nothing to really sue over. It’s like a fire insurance company suing a client for getting an insurance payout after their house burns down."

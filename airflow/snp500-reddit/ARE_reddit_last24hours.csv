I know this sub is all about ""line goes up who cares""
But even after the recent drop, the P/E ratio is still around 110-120.
Doesn't that mean it would take 110 years of profit to buy the entire company at the current stock price?
What technology or product is going to come online that will make Tesla's profit increase ten fold?
For fuck sake, it is a car company ... And they have never sold that many cars when you compare to other car companies.
Someone that truly believes in the stock, explain to me like I am 5 why it will be more valuable in the future.
No political bullshit please, focus on business fundamentals.

I did watch this in it's entirety, someone linked it in a reply, then deleted their comment, strange..
But thank you guy that deleted your comment. https://www.youtube.com/live/QGJysv_Qzkw?si=dDKqc882bW84a8t5
So, so summarize:
FSD Is around the corner, and that will essentially turn every tesla in to a Taxi and they will make people money when they are not using them. (Same lie from 2017? Could be true now??)
The Robots will be the greatest product to ever exist, and will create never ending abundance, and everyone will have everything they want. (Boston Dynamics /waves hello)
They are really an AI company, and oh... they are the best AI company and are already better than everyone else, with their best chips.. (So blatantly false i just don't even know what to say, Didn't be try to buy OpenAI because his AI sucks balls??)","- Join WSB Discord
- Sir this is a casino.
- Fundamentals don’t mean shit
- It's all about feelings
- Didn't you hear Elon talk? He said one tesla car will become equal to 5 or 6 cars. So PE of 110 will become PE of 18-22 and problem is solved.
- I guess, tesla cars will soon start producing offspring at the same rate as Elon.
- Sir, this is a meme stock. Stop trying to justify anything about it.
- Might as well be justify how Fartcoin can be worth $450m. But here we are.
- Hot air rises
- The thesis is that it's not a car company but an AI powerhouse in robo taxis and now robots. About 5-10 years ago the bull thesis was it was a full driverless cars and solar/energy storage.
- It’s the famous Deez Principal. It’s like a fundamental of market dynamics. 
- It’s all computer.
- I love tesler!"

Life happened. Needed the funds. The shares were bought at now post splits pricing of $.43. Oh well.","- Join WSB Discord
- Oh well who needs 4.7 million dollars anyhow.
- 6.5 million if sold around the $150s but who is counting? :)
- What’s going on here? Is this from a decade ago?
- I think he is showing that he sold them in 2014, and what could have been if life didn't get in the way and he kept them until today.
- Watch yourself get scolded by insecure daddy’s money burning 0DTE regards, who will post their wins on their 10th account they didn‘t blow…..yet.
- Honestly was waiting for that onslaught
- Moral of story... never sell any stocks ever. Hold for life. You just never know.
- Then die rich and let your kid cash it out on fart coin
- When I was in high-school economics class in 2001, I did a report on why Nvidia would be the best stock to buy, but I never bought it.
- I also sold about 150k in Dogecoin in 2017. I was swing trading it between .0008 and .001 for a few days. Fuck me."

The economy is literally a massive butterfly effect. Right now, there's a lot of fear driving the market, meaning people are scared about current situations.
“Well what do you mean by this? What situations aside from the tariffs?”
I'm glad you asked: -tariffs (obviously) -housing market softening -unemployment (kind of) -predictions of GDP
There's quite literally a million things that can be listed here, theres also a million things that can be listed that are good. The market is just people, people trade based on sentiment, if they're scared, they will feel like they should sell. Let me give you an example:
John wakes up, looks through his phone and sees 13 news articles on tariffs and potential trade wars sparking, he doesn't think that much of it but realizes it may have carry some short term price raising at his local wally-world. He then goes to wally-world and sees that the price of his favorite avocados and maple syrup are now a bit more expensive. “Shit fuck” He says and realizes it's now affecting him and thinks if it's affecting him it must be affecting everyone. Coming to this realization, he thinks that companies aren't going to keep hiking prices to keep their profit margins high without handing over the customer to their competitors. So he sells his shares in wally-world as he thinks that will happen.
Meanwhile, everyone else is thinking somewhere around this line of thinking. This spikes volatility in the market and the stock price of wally-world is falling, which causes long term investors to see this drop and capitalize on their gains from the previous bull run. Some retards see the stock falling and say “this has to bounce, there's no way this selling momentum can keep going.” So they buy shares on the dip, which causes the price to go up, which causes others to say “it's got upward momentum, I can buy in now and make some money.” this creates more volatility and the cycle repeats itself until eventually the news has died down and people forget about it or it gets resolved.
Moral of the story is, one person's minute actions can tell a story of the whole even if it's through a massive web of assumptions and predictions. An ants only purpose is to move a grain of sand onto the hill outside, have enough ants and you have something that is organized enough to where you can attempt to arbitrarily draw broad assumptions on how the any colony will evolve.

- shut up meg.
- That's Megatron to you
- 
- It’s called consumer sentiment. If consumer feel safe in job and happy consumer buys and economy goes vroom vroom. If consumer worried because tariffs raise prices, inflation going up and jobs lost in government then they save and stop spending, economy goes kplat. It’s not rocket science man.
- As soon as price hit my breakeven point, the sky is the limit, momma ain’t raises no bjtch
- theres also a million things that can be listed that are good.
- You listed the bad things and zero good ones.
- People keep saying there's no reason for the downturn and never present any reason for the upturn, other than ""stonks go up"". Which, yeah.. over a long enough time they do, but downturns can also last years.
- People with a lot of cash can afford to miss the early run up in favor of the long-term gains.. when the market warrants it.
- tl;dr: if bers r dum; y bul smrt?
- Regards buying the dip doesn’t cause price to go up."

It seems like RH exercised my degen $SAVEQ cash secured put options that they shouldn’t be able to since they have nothing to begin with and they can make something (e.g. cash settle it) out of nothing just as you can’t make stuff up out of thin air. What would my legal discourses be in situations like this?","- Join WSB Discord
- I don't really see the error with Robinhoods explanation.
- Are you of the impression that since the stock went bankrupt your cash secured puts you sold got a get out of jail free card?
- You owe the entire thing lol
- Op is a regard, he doesn’t understand what “cash settled” means. #never traded index options probably either
- Ticker: SAVEQ
- Direction: OP thinks they were wrongly assigned shares on cash-secured puts.
- Prognosis: OP believes Robinhood shouldn't have assigned the puts because the underlying shares were delisted before assignment, resulting in a cash settlement of $0. They are seeking legal recourse.
- OP's Confusion (In a Nutshell): If there were no shares to be assigned, why was OP debited $150? Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.
- Robinhood's response: The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process. There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.
- Additional Notes: This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures. The user seems to fundamentally misunderstand how cash settlement of options contracts works when the underlying asset ceases trading before expiration. Consulting with a securities lawyer specializing in options and OCC regulations is recommended for OP.
- ai ftw
- I read this entire thing and understood nothing.
- So did OP
- No, rh is entirely right and youre trying to sovereign citizen your way out of it.
- Thank fuck for the AI because you need to learn how to get your point across without posting 20 fucking pictures lmaooo
- This is just how options work… you sold someone a contract stating you’ll pay them $1.50 per share they own if they choose to exercise it. The shares went to zero, and they chose to exercise the contract. So you paid them $1.50 per share they own, and the shares were transferred from them to you. Since the shares are worth $0, they’re reflected as non existent in your account. Nothing to really sue over. It’s like a fire insurance company suing a client for getting an insurance payout after their house burns down."

Since my last post about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.
Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.
Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.
My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead. Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.
Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.","- Join WSB Discord
- DD need positions screenshots

- So changing this to discussion
- Oh ok my bad
- Congrats, you managed to take a screenshot this time.
- Learning faster than AI!
- Would recommend using 10x P/E as the mean exit multiple instead - that’s what I typically saw used for consumer finance businesses (although granted this was like a year ago when I looked at some of these businesses).
- Shut the fuck up Noob
- Bought Poooots
- It's a fucking bank, banks trade at 10-15 PEs, even the ones with decent growth rates great FCF and income.

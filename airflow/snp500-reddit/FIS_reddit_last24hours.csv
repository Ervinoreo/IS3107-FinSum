Since my last post about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.
Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.
Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.
My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead. Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.
Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.","- Join WSB Discord

- Would recommend using 10x P/E as the mean exit multiple instead - thatâ€™s what I typically saw used for consumer finance businesses (although granted this was like a year ago when I looked at some of these businesses).

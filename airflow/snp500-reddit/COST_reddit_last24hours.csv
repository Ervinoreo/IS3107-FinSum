- Honestly was waiting for that onslaught
- What’s going on here? Is this from a decade ago?
- I think he is showing that he sold them in 2014, and what could have been if life didn't get in the way and he kept them until today.
- Moral of story... never sell any stocks ever. Hold for life. You just never know.

- When I was in high-school economics class in 2001, I did a report on why Nvidia would be the best stock to buy, but I never bought it.
- I also sold about 150k in Dogecoin in 2017. I was swing trading it between .0008 and .001 for a few days. Fuck me."

Since my last post about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.
Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.
Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.
My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead. Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.
Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.","- Join WSB Discord
- DD need positions screenshots

- So changing this to discussion
- Oh ok my bad
- Congrats, you managed to take a screenshot this time.
- Learning faster than AI!
- Would recommend using 10x P/E as the mean exit multiple instead - that’s what I typically saw used for consumer finance businesses (although granted this was like a year ago when I looked at some of these businesses).
- Shut the fuck up Noob
- Bought Poooots
- It's a fucking bank, banks trade at 10-15 PEs, even the ones with decent growth rates great FCF and income.
